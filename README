Rismo2D is a hydrodynamic numerical computer program to solve for the
depth-averaged shallow water equations by means of the Finite Element
Method. Rismo2D was developed during a research project funded by the
German Research Foundation (DFG) at the Institute of Hydraulic Enginee-
ring and Water Resources Management - Aachen University:

The development of a numerical computational method
for near-natural streams
DFG-Project Ro 365 / 31

Rismo2D computes the water elevation and the depth-averaged velocity
for stationary or instationary streams. Based on a Finite Element
discretization the computation can be carried out for arbitrary water-
courses with complex geometrical and hydraulical boundary conditions.

Different laws may be used to account for bottom roughness. The friction
of non-submerged flood plain vegetation may be computed by means of
geometrical parameters.

The approximation of the (turbulent) Reynolds stresses is based on
Boussinesqs principle of eddy viscosity, where the eddy viscosity may
be computed with different closure models:

    constant eddy viscosity predefined by the user
    algebraic shear stress model (anisotropic / Elder)
    k-e-turbulence model 

Decoupled from the flow simulation the conservative transport of matter
in solution or suspension may be computed by solving the depth-averaged
advection diffusion equation.
